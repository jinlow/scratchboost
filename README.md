# Scratch Implementation
This is a small example of XGBoost built mainly using numpy.

## Testing it out
First git clone the repo, and then run the following command in the root of the directory.
```shell
pip install -e .
```
To be able to run tests, you will need to install the dev dependencies.
```shell
pip install -e .[test]
```
